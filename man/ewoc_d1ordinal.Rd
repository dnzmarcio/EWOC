}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{\link[Formula]{Formula}}: a symbolic
description of the model to be fitted with two regressor parts separated by `|`
corresponding to the dose and covariable, respectively, for the right side and
a matrix as a response containing number of DLT and number of patients for
the left side.}

\item{theta}{a numerical value defining the proportion of expected patients
to experience a medically unacceptable, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) if
administered the MTD.}

\item{alpha}{a numerical value defining the probability that the dose selected
by EWOC is higher than the MTD.}

\item{rho_prior}{a matrix of hyperparameters for the Beta prior distribution
associated with each rho. Each row corresponds to a paramater.}

\item{mtd_prior}{a matrix of hyperparameters for the Beta prior distribution
associated with the MTD. Each row corresponds to a paramater.}

\item{levels_cov}{a character vector of the possible values for the ordinal covariable.}

\item{type}{a character describing the type of the Maximum Tolerable Dose
(MTD) variable.}

\item{first_dose}{a numerical value for the first allowable dose in the trial.
It is only necessary if type = 'continuous'.}

\item{last_dose}{a numerical value for the last allowable dose in the trial.
It is only necessary if type = 'continuous'.}

\item{dose_set}{a numerical vector of allowable doses in the trial. It is only
necessary if type = 'discrete'.}

\item{min_dose}{a numerical value defining the lower bound of the support of
the MTD.}

\item{max_dose}{a numerical value defining the upper bound of the support of
the MTD.}

\item{rounding}{a character indicating how to round a continuous dose to the
one of elements of the dose set. It is only necessary if type = 'discrete'.}

\item{n_adapt}{the number of iterations for adaptation.
See \code{\link[rjags]{adapt}} for details.}

\item{burn_in}{the number of iterations before to start monitoring.}

\item{n_mcmc}{the number of iterations to monitor.}

\item{n_thin}{thinning interval for monitors.}

\item{n_chains}{the number of parallel chains for the model.}

\item{next_patient_cov}{a character value indicating the covariable associated to
next patient.}
}

\code{pdlt} the probability of DLT for the next dose.

\code{hpd_pdlt} the 95\% HPD for the probability of DLT for the next dose.

\code{sample} a list of the MCMC chains distribution.

\code{trial} a list of trial conditions.
